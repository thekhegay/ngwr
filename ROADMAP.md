# Roadmap

Effects ship as `ngwr/animations/*` entry points, written from scratch in library idiom. Each one keeps its text readable to screen readers, renders under SSR and holds still under `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Very high

## High

## Medium

## Low

- **`wr-graph` zoom and pan**: zoom in and out and drag the field, like NG-ZORRO's
  graph. Selection and highlight come after that.

## Very low

- **`ngwr/kit` standalone utilities**: publish the internal signal utils,
  positioning, density, hotkey and storage helpers as a zero-dep package usable
  without the components.
- **Ejectable components**: keep npm and `ng update`, and add a schematic that
  copies a component's source into the user's repo.
